## Description of project:
### Design Challenge

My project would help users set personalized ethical goals regarding their own food consumption. This app serves the function of fulfilling the human need for self actualization via food consumption rather than their physiological needs. More and more, the food consumer culture in America has evolved towards greater awareness of ethical issues such as environmental issues/sustainability, human rights issues (fair trade), and animal rights issues. Current solutions that help humans set ethical food consumption goals  tend to focus on one type of goal. For instance, there are apps that help people become vegetarians, or diminish carbon foodprint, but there are no apps that enables its users to set a comprehensive set of goals that guides them to become a better person in alignment with their value systems. Existing apps also oftentimes dictate one standard of ethical eating, and doesn't allow its users to customize their consumption of food based on their personal ethical priorities. This app would allow users to customize what's important to them. Furthermore, the app will diminish the enormous information barriers for users so that they wouldn't have to conduct comprehensive research in order to find out how to achieve their ethical goals. This app will help users set personal goals, and provide customizable plans to help them achieve these goals. 

### Target Users: 

The target audience would be goal-oriented, and socially conscious college students. 

### Research Method:
I conducted interview with participatory observations. I interviewed my subjects in person in their homes, or via facebook call. I collected user data through voice/video recording, and observe how they interact with existing goal-tracking apps. 

## Interview Guide:
Decide where to visit: Homes of college students

Decide what activities to observe/ what to ask to do: Ask about how they make their food consumption choices + observe how they interact with other similar apps (if the interview was in person, and if the interviewee uses a goal-tracking app)

Decide how to interact with the users: Ask them questions one-on-one

Decide how to collect user data: voice/video recording

## Reflections:
From this contexual analysis, I learned that it's very difficult for users to have the initial motivation to go onto an app that will change their habits and lifestyle. Also, convenience is extremely important to users in habit tracking apps. In addition, financial constraints is a major obstacle preventing users from making ethical choices.

Next time, I would like to think of ways to ask questions that doesn't sound like I'm blaming them or judging them for their food choices. I feel like asking questions about whether they care about the environment can make my interviewee feel like I'm judging them if they don't, and they feel awkward answering that question. In addition, I'd like to observe more how they make plans to eat with friends, and how a group of friends decide where to go out to eat together.
