## Purpose of User Testing:
The purpose of usability testing is to improve the effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of users to achieve specific goals. By observing how users interact with the product and receiving user feedback, we can better understand which features of the product is intuitive, and which features needs to be redesigned. This will improve the overall usability of the product. I want to test how easy it is to complete tasks that are essential to the website "Letterboxd", such as logging film entries, voicing opinions about films, and exploring potential films to watch. According to my heuristic evaluation, the wording of heading icons in the website is often unintuitive and undistiguishable from each other. For instance, the headings of "Activity", "Film", and "Lists" could be confusing since they don't provide clear information about what content can be found within each tab. For this UT, I want to test if other users are also confused about what content will be available under the different heading tabs.
