## Purpose of User Testing:
The purpose of usability testing is to improve the effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of users to achieve specific goals. By observing how users interact with the product and receiving user feedback, we can better understand which features of the product is intuitive, and which features needs to be redesigned. This will improve the overall usability of the product. I want to test how easy it is to complete tasks that are essential to the website "Letterboxd", such as logging film entries, voicing opinions about films, and exploring potential films to watch. According to my heuristic evaluation, the wording of heading icons in the website is often unintuitive and undistiguishable from each other. For instance, the headings of "Activity", "Film", and "Lists" could be confusing since they don't provide clear information about what content can be found within each tab. For this UT, I want to test if other users are also confused about what content will be available under the different heading tabs.

## What I learned:
During the pilot test, I learned that the website is actually surprisingly intuitive and easy to use for new users. My test volunteer isn't a film buff and never developed the habit of logging films that she watched, but after going through the UT and being introduced to the app, she said she will start to use it outside of the research. However, there are still components that are confusing about the website. Per my instructions during the UT, Tiffany saved a film as watched, but attempted to find the film that she just saved in the "Watchlist" tab. However, the watchlist actually shows a list of films that the user wants to watch, instead of already watched. The labeling of the tab is confusing. I thought the UT went well since my volunteer was relaxed and focused on the executing each task. She understood the scenario and my instructions clearly. She also verbalized her thoughts to a certain extent. In the future, I want to improve by adding more short answer questions which prompts a more indepth discussion than my simple rating questions. I also want to just discuss with her about how she feels about the website and allow her to explore the website on her own to better observe her spontaneous interaction with it.
