## Purpose of User Testing:
The purpose of usability testing is to improve the effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of users to achieve specific goals. By observing how users interact with the product and receiving user feedback, we can better understand which features of the product is intuitive, and which features needs to be redesigned. This will improve the overall usability of the product. I want to test how easy it is to complete tasks that are essential to the website "Letterboxd", such as logging film entries, voicing opinions about films, and exploring potential films to watch. According to my heuristic evaluation, the wording of icons in the website could be unintuitive and not found in the real world
