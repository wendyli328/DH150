*By Wendy Li (DH 150-Professor Cho)*

UX Mission Statement: I would like to contribute to the community of avid film and television consumers who are looking for more accessible ways to watch content.

### Summary: 

Netflix is an over-the-top, direct-to-consumer platform that provides on-demand film and television programming. 

### Overall evaluation: 

Netflix has incredible user experience design....

## 10 Heuristics Analysis:

### 1. Visibility of system status 
	Always keep users informed about what is going on.
	Provide appropriate feedback within reasonable time. 

Evaluation: 

Netflix includes a clearly visible navigation bar at the top of its landing page. Since the viewers' gaze scans from left to right, Netflix prioritizes information important to the viewers (ie. whether they want to watch a movie or a show) on the top corner of the left side of the landing page, and places administrative account information at the right corner of the landing page. Furthermore, the location of the navigation bars is consistent on every page in Netflix, so the user knows where to look to find out what page they are on. Furthermore, once the user selects a button on the navigation bar (ie. Home/TV Shows/Movie), the button becomes bolded. This provides appropriate feedback to the user and informs his or her that their interaction was successful. Overall, Netflix very well satisfies the first heuristic. 

Severity Ratings: n/a (I don't believe there is a major usability issue)

### 2. Match between system and the real world 
	Speak the users' language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. 
	Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order. 

Evaluation: 

Netflix consistently uses words and phrases familiar to the user such as "TV Shows" "Movies" "Latest" "Home". However, words such as "My Netflix" is less clear in world world context, and require the users to learn that it comprises lists of shows that the user watched in the past, and lists of shows the the user favorited. Nevertheless, I thought this categorization made sense because it basically comprises content personalized for the user, hence it's called "My Netflix". In addition, the icons on the right hand of the page does not have obvious meaning to the user. I wouldn't know what the present icon meant unless I clicked into it and learned that I can purchase Netflix as a gift to a friend. 

Severity Ratings: 1 (Some of the terms are unfamiliar to the user, but since they are easy to learn, they will not cause severe confusion and frustration)


### 3. User control and freedom 
	Users often choose system functions by mistake.
	Provide a clearly marked "out" to leave an unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. 
	Support undo and redo. 

Evaluation: 

Netflix provides a high degree of user control and freedom. If the user accidentally click into any show or movie on the landing page, a banner with the description of the content shows up in the center of the page, without covering the rest of the landing page. This banner has a clear exit sign, and the viewer can clearly see the rest of the landing page beneath the banner, they will remain oriented to their position in the website once they exit the banner. However, there is one issue regarding this heuristic that Netflix can potentially improve on. When a user clicks into a picture, the exit symbol is demonstrated by an "X" on the right upper corner as the picture loads. However, after the picture finishes loading and the movie plays, the user can only exit by pressing the arrow button on the left upper corner. The change of position is confusing and makes it harder to exit. 

Severity Ratings: 2 (User uses the exit function frequently, and it would be frustrating if they can't find it since it changed place)

### 4. Consistency and standards 
	Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. 
	Follow platform conventions. 

Evaluation: 

Netflix uses consistent wording on all navigation buttons (ie. "TV Shows" "Movie"). In addition, it's layout of films and tv shows is consistent across all pages. On every page, shows are seperated into categories that are vertically laid out on the page. Each image has the same dimension and same distance between them. The only exception to this is when Netflix wants to draw greater attention to certain shows, such as its Netflix Originals, it will make the images of those shows larger. 

Severity Ratings: n/a (I don't believe there are significant problems)

5. Error prevention 
	Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. 

Evaluation: 
Netflix attempts to prevent users from starting a movie by accidentally clicking into it by showing the banner of the film the first time the user clicks on its image. If the user clicks a second time, the movie will actually start. However, this isn't fail-proof since the users can easily misclick the play button and end up starting a movie they don't want to watch. Other types of error on Netflix are often network related errors (the wifi is down), so it's not as preventable. 

Severity Rating: 2 (It could be annoying if the user accidentally clicks into a film and has to go through the hassle of existing, and this mistake could happen frequently)


6. Recognition rather than recall 
	Make objects, actions, and options visible. 
	User should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another. 
	Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate. 

Evaluation: 
For the most part, Netflix makes it easy for users to find a show they are looking for by finding it in their watch history, or in their saved list. If users are looking for a movie they've already seen, they don't have to recall the titles of the movie, but simply have to recognize the movie's image in the list. However, although Netflix has a watch history, it doesn't have a search history. Therefore, users would have to recall titles they've searched for in the past but haven't watched. 

Severity Rating: 1 (Netflix has designed their website to encourage users to find new content through exploration rather than from searching for a title; thus, this problem hasn't impacted my experience)


7. Flexibility and efficiency of use 
	Accelerators -- unseen by the novice user -- may often speed up the interaction for the expert user so that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. 
	Allow users to tailor frequent actions. 

Short cut-- you can choose to play directly or open it. But sometimes you can accidentally click in when you're trying to read the description.

8. Aesthetic and minimalist design 
	Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. 
	Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility.

9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors 
	Expressed in plain language (no codes)
	Precisely indicate the problem
	Constructively suggest a solution.

10. Help and documentation 
	Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. 
	Help  information should be easy to search, focused on the user's task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large.
