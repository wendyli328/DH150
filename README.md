# The Good Fridge Project
## DH 150 UX Design, Wendy Li

## Introduction: 
My project would help users set personalized ethical goals regarding their own food consumption. This app serves the function of fulfilling the human need for self actualization via food consumption rather than their physiological needs. 

## Design Statement:
The food consumer culture in America has evolved towards greater awareness of ethical issues such as environmental issues/sustainability, human rights issues (fair trade), and animal rights issues. Current solutions that help humans set ethical food consumption goals tend to focus on one type of goal. For instance, there are apps that help people become vegetarians, or diminish carbon foodprint, but there are no apps that enables its users to set a comprehensive set of goals that guides them to become a better person in alignment with their value systems. Existing apps also oftentimes dictate one standard of ethical eating, and doesn't allow its users to customize their consumption of food based on their personal ethical priorities. This app would allow users to customize what's important to them. Furthermore, the app will diminish the enormous information barriers for users so that they wouldn't have to conduct comprehensive research in order to find out how to achieve their ethical goals. This app will help users set personal goals, and provide customizable plans to help them achieve these goals.
