# Description of your project:
"The Good Fridge" is an app that helps users make ethical decisions regarding food consumption in alignment with their personal goals. The purpose of the high fidelity prototyping phase is to help envision the minimal viable functions of the app cohesively, and attempt to imagine how these functions interact with each other. Through the process of choosing a color scheme, deciding the tone and language of the texts shown, and choosing the various visual icons, I was better able to give the app a personality and voice as it communicates with the user. 

# A list of tasks that the interactive prototype of your system supported:
1. Users can chooze and customize their ethical food consumption goals based on their interests
2. User can input their grocery list and receive feedback on changes they can make to their list in order to meet their ethical food consumption goals
3. Users can input their grocery receipts and receive a breakdown of how they are doing in their journey to reach their ethical goals that month
4. Users can view their progress towards their goals in their personal profile page
5. Users can view a simplified visual breakdown of the food they are consuming in their home page. The page is designed to invoke the homey feeling of opening the fridge and viewing what's inside.

# Link to the interactive prototype or embed window that shows the prototype.

# If you have multiple versions of prototypes by reflecting the evaluation with others, provide them with the description of what you learned from otherâ€™s feedback and what you have made the changes.
