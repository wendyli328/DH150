## Description of project:
### Design Challenge

My project would help users set personal goals for self improvement by recommending the food to eat. This app serves the function of fulfilling the human need for self actualization via food consumption rather than their physiological needs. For instance, humans eat to be more environmental, to be more adventurist, to be healthier. Current solutions that help humans set personal goals that they want to accomplish via the food that they consume tend to focus on one type of goal. For instance, there are apps that help people become vegetarians, diminish carbon foodprint, lose weight, but there are no apps that enables its users to set a comprehensive set of goals that guides them to become a better person in alignment with their value systems. Users often want to eat food in accordance with their personal goals, but is faced with enormous information barriers and must conduct comprehensive research in order to find out how to achieve these goals. This app will help users set personal goals, and provide customizable plans to help them achieve these goals. 

### Target Users: 

The target audience would be goal-oriented, and preferably socially conscious college students. I would observe them making decisions on where to eat food at home, while they are making their grocery lists or while they are deciding where to eat at. 

### Research Method:
I conducted interview with participatory observations. I interviewed my subjects in their homes individually, and observed them as they made choices about what to include on their grocery list. I collected user data through voice recording, and photos of their grocery lists.
