# Description of Project:

The Good Fridge is an app that helps users make ethical choices in their everyday food consumption. The target user for this app are mainly socially-conscious college students who want to eat in ways that align with their ethical goals. They either lack the information regarding the processes behind their food purchases, or they are inundated with too many choices and have a hard time making the best choice that's in alignment with their ethical goals. The purpose of this low-fidelity prototyping is to test the workflow and intuitiveness of the features listed below:

# App Features:
1. Users can choose ethical issues that are important to them, and the app will narrow the multitude of issues into 3 concrete goals that the user can work on. 

2. Users can upload their grocery list, and get suggestions on the best food products to buy to achieve their ethical goals. 

3. Users can upload their grocery receipts, and get breakdown on how they are doing in regards to their ethical goals. 

4. Users can check their progress at anytime towards their ethical goal. 

5. Users can access personalized data regarding their food consumption.

# Reflection: 
From my prototype testing, I observed that users had trouble finding the page of grocery suggestions. They explored every page but couldn't find where to press in order to receive suggestions on what to buy at the grocery market. I learned that the grocery list inputting page isn't clear. It doesn't directly prompt users to input their grocery list in order to get suggestions. Users are confused about the "save" button, since it doesn't indicate further action. I will change the language on the buttons in order to make it more clear, and perhaps add an explanation on that page that after they input their grocery list, they will receive suggestions on what to buy. 

In general, I learned from prototype creating that there are a million ways to present the same set of information, and a lot of thinking and testing and researching is required to find the best way. Furthermore, I learned that this process requires many back-and-forth reiterations of the same design. I ended up testing out 6 or 7 different icons, and multiple arrangements in attempt to find the one that makes the most sense. Lastly, there are times that I felt stuck since my design doesn't feel intuitive but I don't know how to fix it. I relied on research of the UI/UX designs of other apps for inspiration to fix my design flaws.
