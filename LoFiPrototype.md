# Description of Project:

The Good Fridge is an app that helps users make ethical choices in their everyday food consumption. The target user for this app are mainly socially-conscious college students who want to eat in ways that align with their ethical goals. They either lack the information regarding the processes behind their food purchases, or they are inundated with too many choices and have a hard time making the best choice that's in alignment with their ethical goals. The purpose of this low-fidelity prototyping is to test the workflow and intuitiveness of the features listed below:

# App Features:
1. Users can choose ethical issues that are important to them, and the app will narrow the multitude of issues into 3 concrete goals that the user can work on. 

2. Users can upload their grocery list, and get suggestions on the best food products to buy to achieve their ethical goals. 

3. Users can upload their grocery receipts, and get breakdown on how they are doing in regards to their ethical goals. 

4. Users can check their progress at anytime towards their ethical goal. 

5. Users can access personalized data regarding their food consumption.
